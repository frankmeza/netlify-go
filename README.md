# Documentation v1

I have frankenstein'd the projects of others and behold it lives!

The shoulders upon which I stand belong to:
- [Carl M Johnson](https://github.com/carlmjohnson) wrote https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2020/how-to-host-golang-on-netlify-for-free/ which served as the first layer of the project and got everything straightened out with Netlify,
- [David Stotijn](https://github.com/dstotijn) wrote (https://v0x.nl/articles/portable-apps-go-nextjs) which served as the starting point for the client/server relationship between a Next.js app and the pre-existing Go server from the first project.
